Today's goal is to update your forked repository and then create a Pull Request

Task
1. Ensure your forked repository is in sync with the latest changes in the main repository. Also ensure that the git branch that you created in Challenge 2 is also in sync with the latest changes
2. Create a new folder inside the `contributors` folder, and name it with your github username. It should look something like this `contributors/<YOUR-GITHUB_USERNAME>/`. Ex.

```
contributors/shivaylamba/
```

3. Create a markdown file in the folder you created following the naming convention for the file: `<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.md`. Ex.

```
contributors/shivaylamba/shivaylamba.md
```

4. Copy the following template into your file, delete the placeholder text and fill the information with yours.

```
