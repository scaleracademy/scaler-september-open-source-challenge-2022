## Welcome to Challenge 29

Welcome to the 29th Challenge! 

It is great to see such an enthusiastic participation by everyone in the challenges so far. In order to further foster this adoption of open source amongst the community, we want ideas on open source projects from all of you. We want to give the opportunity to all of you to come up with some ideas about good open source projects that might be beneficial for the entire Discord community and even outside. 

Nowadays a lot of developer tools are becoming popular, so if you have any ideas of such tools that might be beneficial to developers, do share those with us! 

How to do it?

1. Go to the Scaler Open Source Projects Repository (https://github.com/scaleracademy/open-source-projects/discussions/categories/ideas)
2. Under the Github Discussions we have a section for ideas. Here you can share any project ideas that you may feel will be beneficial for the open source community or might be a good developer tool. 
3. Checkout the existing ideas other community members have already shared, and if you like any of the ideas, upvote them. 
4. Create a new discussion if you want to share a new project idea. And inside the section for adding the details of the project idea, do share detailed description for the project in case you are creating a new project idea. 
5. Whether you like an existing idea or pitch in with a new one, share screenshot for it on the issues created in the previous challenges. 
6. Top most upvoted project ideas will be taken up Scaler open source.
