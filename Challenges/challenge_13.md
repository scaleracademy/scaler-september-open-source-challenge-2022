## Welcome to Challenge 13

Welcome to the 13th Challenge 

Today's challenge involves how to use ``git stash`` command effectively. You can refer on how to stash your commits [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning)

Task: 
1. Inside the branch you created in the previous challenge ``your-username-details`` create a new file inside the ``contributors/<YOUR-GITHUB_USERNAME>/`` directory.
2. Use the git stash command to move these changes to the stash area
3. Delete the content from the stash area and share a screenshot of this inside the Github issue you created in the first challenge
