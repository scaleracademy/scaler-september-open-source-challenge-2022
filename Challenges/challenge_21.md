## Welcome to Challenge 21

Welcome to the 21st Challenge 

Today we will be learning about Git Aliases! :). This is an amazing feature that helps us use less keystroke

 The term alias is synonymous with a shortcut. Alias creation is a common pattern found in other popular utilities like `bash` shell. Aliases are used to create shorter commands that map to longer commands. Aliases enable more efficient workflows by requiring fewer keystrokes to execute a command. To learn more;
