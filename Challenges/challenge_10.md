## Welcome to Challenge 10

Welcome to the 10th challenge! 

Today's challenge is based on the concept of signing your commits. Signing the commits is a way of showing that only authentic commits are being made. 

A lot of open source projects have DCO which stands for [Developer Certification of Origin](https://github.com/apps/dco) including this repository itself and it tries to verify that each commit is signed or not. In case your commit is not signed it will reflect in the pull request that it doesn't pass the DCO test. 

You can read more about how to sign commits [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)

Task: 
1. Setup the ability to sign commits locally in your systems 
2. Whenever committing in the future always try to use signed commits 
3. Make a new signed commit to the pull request that you have made in previous challenges by making this change to the ``yourusername.md`` file: 
```
