## Welcome to Challenge 26

Welcome to the 26th Challenge! 
As we continue to expand into open source contributions, share your learnings so far with folks on the Discord channel. And if anyone is struggling, definitely feel free to reach out on the group. We encourage collaboration amongst all the folks to upskill each other and contribute to open source. 

Also registrations for Hacktoberfest start today, so do register for it. 

# Task: 
- Do register today for https://hacktoberfest.com/ 
- Help out other folks, collaborate with each other as well for contributing to open source projects
