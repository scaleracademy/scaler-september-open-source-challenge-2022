## Welcome to Challenge 19

Welcome to the 19th Challenge 

Today's challenge is unique. Today we will learn about code linting. A linter is defined as follows: 
- Lint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. 

So in order to ensure proper codestyling and structure, there are checks run on pull requests to ensure the code is properly linted. We have also placed a code linter Github action which will keep a track whether your code is properly linted or not. 

Task: 
1. Create a new file inside your branch created in previous challenges ``your-username-details`` under the directory ``contributors/username``. The file needs to be a source code file written in your preferred programming language. The code can be anything you want: hello world program or your favorite program. 
2. Commit the change and push it. 
3. Check if your linting fails in side the Pull request: <img width="870" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19529592/190969615-f3205b26-83eb-4b5f-b7a5-19567a575a9a.png"> <br> Then lint your code to ensure that this check passes inside your pull request.
