## Welcome to Challenge 12

Welcome to the 12th Challenge 

Today's challenge is a re-practice of the 7th Challenge (https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-september-open-source-challenge/blob/main/Challenges/challenge_7.md?plain=1)

So focus for this challenge will be to practice the ``git rebase`` command. We still see a number of Pull requests that have a lot more commits than there should be, therefore we give you a chance to correct it again. 

Ensure to practice the ``git rebase`` command by creating your own local git repository. You can checkout this guide: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-squash-explained/

Task: 
1. Practice git rebase, and how to squash commit using git rebase in your local projects 
2. Once done, try to squash the commits in your pull request in the Challenge repository
3. We also see a lot of challengers are not signing their commits. Refer to Challenge 10: https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-september-open-source-challenge/blob/main/Challenges/challenge_10.md and ensure to sign your commits.
