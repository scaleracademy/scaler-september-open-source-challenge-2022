## Welcome to Challenge 24

Welcome to the 24th Challenge 

We hope all of you learnt about some good practices when it comes to contributing to open source projects. 

Now the time has come for all of you to start contributing to open source projects. One of the best ways to contribute to open source projects is starting with good first issues. You can find these type of issues by going to the issues tab of the Github repositories of open source projects and looking for the good first issue or other similarly named labels
(repositoryname/labels).

We are making it easier to find good first issues. 

Take a look at this website: https://goodfirstissue.dev/ 

This website has a number of different projects with good first issues, and you can also search specifically based on different languages. So try to find a project you like and feel comfortable contributing to. If you don't find any specific project, then explore Github and search for any open source projects you may want to contribute to and look for good first issues. 

Note: Whether you are a new contributor or a regular open source contributor, you are not limited to just good first issues. If you feel comfortable taking up other open source issues, then feel free to do so. Good first issues are recommended for beginners, so that they don't get overwhelmed. 

Remember that whenever contributing to open source, be polite. 

Also check whenever you wish to contribute to a project/issue sometimes that issue might already been actively worked on and might be assigned to someone. So look carefully and only then respond to an open issue. 

Most projects either come with a ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` file or might have details on how to make contributions to a project, whether it is through creation of an issue, or creating a Pull Request. So remember to go through those details for the specific project you wish to contribute to.

Task: 
Today's task is not just 1 day task, this task could take you more than 1 day, but that is fine. 

What we want all of you to do is, start exploring for open source projects and projects where you would like to contribute, and just tell us your progress that you made. 

At the end of the day, comment on the issue created in previous challenges with the update you have made in today's challenge. Whether you are still looking for issues or you may have found one, requested for yourself to get assigned to it and started working on it. Or you are struggling to understand what to do. Just update on the issue and continue to explore. Open source doesn't come easy. It will take time and you have to be patient. So just update on where you are on your journey of contributing to open source projects!
