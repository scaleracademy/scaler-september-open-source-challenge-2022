## Welcome to Challenge 23

Welcome to the 23rd Challenge 

So far all of you have learnt the basics of Git and Github. 
Now let's move to the next step and actually start contributing to real open source projects but before we do that it is super important to go through the contributing guidelines for that project. 

Most projects either come with a ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` file or might have details on how to make contributions to a project, whether it is through creation of an issue, or creating a Pull Request. 

A Sample ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` file can be found [here](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), 

Here are some resources for good practices for git branch naming conventions, pull request creation and issue triaging:

2. https://tighten.com/blog/building-a-great-pull-request/
3. https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/
4. https://youtu.be/8wt-8B9vCQg


Task: 
Today's task is simple but super important, go through all these links, and summarize what you learn about what needs to be done for effective open source contribution, especially with respect to open source issue creation, best practices around branch/pull request creation. 

Add this as a comment in the issue created in prior challenges
