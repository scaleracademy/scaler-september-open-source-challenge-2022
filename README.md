## What is the Scaler September Open Source Challenge?
Link for [Notion page](https://scalerdiscord.notion.site/scalerdiscord/Open-Source-September-Scaler-Discord-Community-f9306c7dc15a464ba1b6ea7ee30cdf0d).

Every day throughout September, for those who have enrolled, we will share one task. 
Participants will need to use their knowledge of Git and Github for each task, and the difficulty level of the tasks will rise daily.

The primary objective? To help the community become better at contributing to open source and building projects.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Learn how to contribute to open source projects. Learn the basics of creating issues, pull requests, Git and Github
2. Celebrate with new rewards every time you reach a milestone!

## How to participate?

### Step 1

Accept the challenge by filling out this form: [https://bit.ly/opensourcesepbyscaler](https://bit.ly/opensourcesepbyscaler) 

### Step 2

If you haven't already, create an account on Github, and brush up on your skills in Git and Github. 

### Step 3

Head to the official [Scaler Open Source challenge repository](https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-september-open-source-challenge/). Star it. 

Keep track of the README, as a new task will be added every day. 

Please go through the task for that day and solve it. 

### Step 4

Don't forget to share your progress within the community if you want those rewards!

## Prizes
Consistency is what we're after. As a result, we have several levels or awards based on how consistently you complete the assignments.
You won't be qualified for the remaining tasks of the challenge if you are unable to complete and submit a task on any given day.
